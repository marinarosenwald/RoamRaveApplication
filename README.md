# Summary of Project
Our mobile app will transform travel and food experiences, catering to the 74% of consumers in the $9.5 trillion travel and tourism industry who want more individualized content (Vrountas, n.d.; WTTC, 2023). It seeks to increase user engagement by as much as 40% through cutting-edge technologies (McKinsey & Company, 2021). Upon arriving in a new city, travelers can open our app to discover top-rated eateries, cozy cafes, and local hotspots on our travel map. Tailored for young travelers, aged 20s to 30s, our app optimizes planning time and eliminates stress by providing well-vetted recommendations. Let the adventure begin!
# Project Analysis
## Value Proposition
This is a travel application for people in their 20s to 30s that will suggest well-vetted things to do in new cities. Research shows that Millennials and Gen Z, who make up a significant portion of travelers, use online resources to plan trips, with 87% searching for top-rated local activities (Source: World Tourism Organization, 2021).
Pain points include: 
Time-consuming Itinerary Planning: On average, travelers spend over 10 hours planning trips (Source: Expedia, 2022).
Inconsistency in the quality of recommendations: Very often, users will find recommendations of very low quality that do not meet their required or expected standards.
Overlooked Local Gems: Many unique local spots are overshadowed by more popular or commercialized locations.
## Primary Purpose
The primary purpose of our application is to make traveling more enjoyable and stress-free for young travelers by providing them with a variety of screened activities and eateries. 
Target Audience
Our target demographic is travelers in their 20s to 30s. We want to target people who are adventurous and willing to try new things as we will give a variety of ideas on our application. We are targeting younger adults as there are already a lot of applications for travelers over 40 and those who travel in families such as Yelp and TripAdvisor. To reach our target audience we will utilize social media platforms where our target audience is most active such as TikTok and Instagram. 
## Success Criteria
Our success criteria is user satisfaction. We want people to enjoy traveling and have safe options to choose from when selecting activities/bars/restaurants. We will also rely on user feedback to maintain current suggestions, thus user interaction is crucial to the success of our product, and users’ willingness to interact with us is dependent on their satisfaction with our product. To measure user satisfaction we will have a feedback survey embedded in our application where users can rate their experience and give feedback. 
## Competitor Analysis
Yelp: Yelp offers a huge user base, and with business listings ranging from, Yelp has grown to be considered the leading resource for reviews and local business information. However, the major pitfall would lie in its responsiveness to provide users with tailored suggestions, hence making the UX overwhelming, considering the various options available to them. This often adopts a one-size-fits-all approach and does not usually appeal to the particular preferences and interests of the individual, more so among the youth and the technologically driven travelers who want to have much more distinct and personalized experiences.
TripAdvisor: TripAdvisor, on the other hand, is better off in the provision of good quality travel-related content, especially good and detailed reviews by users. The strength is in the detail of information available to the user in making decisions. This includes comprehensive user feedback that could be beneficial to the traveler in arriving at this decision. However, the platform that TripAdvisor and Booking.com use to offer their services targets a whole lot of potential consumers, among them families and older travelers. It doesn't apply any 'catchy' to be on trend with its target for youth or spontaneity market. Such a broader focus could, perhaps, dilute the relevance of such content for the younger user looking for quick, adventurous, and personalized travel experiences.
The two platforms are strong in their domains and hence do not offer a complete solution to the needs of the core audience at RoamRave: a youthful audience in their 20s to 30s who are inherently spontaneous travelers. Our app attempts to bridge this gap through tailored recommendations and a user design specifically aimed at targeting this demographic, hence providing a service that is ever more relevant and ever more engaging for the young, dynamic travelers of today.
## Monetization Model
We can monetize our application by allowing businesses to pay to be promoted on our application. For example, if an eatery in Seattle wants to show up on our suggested list, they can pay us a fee and we will insert them into our list with the tag “paid promotion”.
